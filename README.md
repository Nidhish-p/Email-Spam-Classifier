# 📧 Email Spam Classifier (Naive Bayes + NLP)

This project focuses on building an **Email Spam Classifier** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and the **Naive Bayes algorithm**. The model classifies emails into two categories: **Spam** and **Not Spam**, after performing data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.

## 🛠️ Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning** → Removed noise, punctuations, special characters, stopwords.  
2. **Feature Extraction** → Converted text into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF**.  
3. **Model Training** → Applied **Naive Bayes** algorithm for classification.  
4. **Model Evaluation** → Validated performance with classification metrics.
